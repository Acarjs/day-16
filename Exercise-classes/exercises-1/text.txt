Exercise 1: Products
1 Create an object representing a product in an e-shop. Give it these properties

name - the name of the product
price - the price of the product in euros
quantity - number of items available in the store
Create an array containing at least 7 different products.
Creating such an array is hard work. Let's create a class Product to make our lives easier.

Create a class named Product
Create a constructor inside of it taking these three parameters: name, price and quantity. In the constructor set the properties of the object to the values of these parameters.
Create the same array as before with the 7 products but now using your class and the new keyword.
Now we add some methods to our class

Add a method called sell() which will sell one product. This will decrease the number of products of this type in the store (decrease the quantity property)
Add a method called store(count) which will put count more products of this type to the store
Making a website

Create a website that displays the products in our array. Display each product with its name, price, and quantity.
Put a buy button next to each item that, when clicked, will call the method sell() on the appropriate object.
